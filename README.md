📊 Data Warehouse Project
This repository contains a Data Warehouse Implementation Project using a Bronze-Silver-Gold Layering Pattern, showcasing SQL-based ETL, star schema design, and structured data modeling for downstream analytics.

🧩 Project Structure
The project follows a layered data warehouse architecture:

1️⃣ Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
Purpose: Stores unprocessed CRM/ERP sales, customer, product, and location data.

Object Type: Tables

Load Method: CSV ingestion (TRUNCATE & INSERT strategy)

Transformations: None (raw data loaded as-is)

2️⃣ Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)
Purpose: Cleansed and standardized data ready for transformation.

Object Type: Tables

Transformations:

Data type alignment

Null handling

Basic enrichment

De-duplication

3️⃣ Gold Layer (Business-Ready Analytics)
Purpose: Provides analytical views for business reporting.

Object Type: Views

Transformations:

Joins across dimensions and fact tables

Aggregations (sales totals, customer-level KPIs)

Business rule application
